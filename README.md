# Multiplayer System

## Introduction
This project focuses on researching and implementing a multiplayer system for games using C++ and the Unity engine. 
I will be testing the working of the multiplayer system by making a simple multiplayer game where players can create and join game sessions where they can interact with each other.

## Technology Stack
- C++
- Unity Engine (2022.3.52f1)
- Visual Studio 2022
- Git for version control
- Network Architecture: listed client-server model
- Protocol: UDP

## Learning Goals
- I understand different network architectures and can apply them in my projects.
- I can implement network communication with multiple devices.
- I can implement basic techniques to reduce latency in multiplayer games.
- I can implement debugging techniques for networking systems.
- I can test and troubleshoot network connections between devices.
- I can develop basic multiplayer systems using C++.

## Research
Here are my research notes on multiplayer systems and the sources I used:

- [Multiplayer Network Architectures](./Docs/MultiplayerNetworkArchitectures.md)
- [TCP VS UDP](./Docs/TCP_VS_UDP.md)
