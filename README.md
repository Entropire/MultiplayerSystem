# Multiplayer System

## Introduction

This project focuses on researching and implementing a multiplayer system for games using C++ and the Unity engine. 
The system is designed with a modular and extensible architecture, ensuring that while it integrates with Unity, it remains loosely coupled. 
This approach allows the multiplayer system to be reused or adapted for other projects and platforms beyond Unity.

## Technology Stack
- C++
- Unity Engine (2022.3.52f1)

## Learning Goals
- I understand different network architectures and can apply them in my projects.
- I can implement network communication with multiple devices.
- I can implement basic techniques to reduce latency in multiplayer games.
- I can implement debugging techniques for networking systems.
- I can test and troubleshoot network connections between devices.
- I can develop basic multiplayer systems using C++.
